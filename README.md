This personal projects aims to showcase the data engineering skills I've learned by building a data processing pipeline from the ground up. In particular, I aim to get my most recent (last 24 hours) played tracks from [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/console/get-recently-played/?limit=50&after=1484811043508&before=) and automate the ETL process using Airflow.

## Demo

This is a sample view of my played tracks on May 1st 2021, as seen on a sqlite viewer.
